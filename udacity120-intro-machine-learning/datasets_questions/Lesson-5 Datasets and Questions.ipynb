    "Adding in the new POI’s in this example, none of whom we have financial information for, has introduced a subtle problem, that our lack of financial information about them can be picked up by an algorithm as a clue that they’re POIs. Another way to think about this is that there’s now a difference in how we generated the data for our two classes--non-POIs all come from the financial spreadsheet, while many POIs get added in by hand afterwards. That difference can trick us into thinking we have better performance than we do--suppose you use your POI detector to decide whether a new, unseen person is a POI, and that person isn’t on the spreadsheet. Then all their financial data would contain “NaN” but the person is very likely not a POI (there are many more non-POIs than POIs in the world, and even at Enron)--you’d be likely to accidentally identify them as a POI, though!\n",
    "\n",
    "This goes to say that, when generating or augmenting a dataset, you should be exceptionally careful if your data are coming from different sources for different classes. It can easily lead to the type of bias or mistake that we showed here. There are ways to deal with this, for example, you wouldn’t have to worry about this problem if you used only email data--in that case, discrepancies in the financial data wouldn’t matter because financial features aren’t being used. There are also more sophisticated ways of estimating how much of an effect these biases can have on your final answer; those are beyond the scope of this course.\n",

    "For now, the takeaway message is to be very careful about introducing features that come from different sources depending on the class! It’s a classic way to accidentally introduce biases and mistakes.\n"
